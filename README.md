## Week-02:
During this week, we have successfully completed the entire HTML structure of our webpage. We worked diligently on every section of the page, including the header, footer, navigation menus, and content areas. The HTML structure provides the necessary foundation for our design and functionality, which means that we are now ready to move on to the next phase of web development. We are excited to see how our webpage will take shape in the coming weeks.
## Week-03: 
On the third week, we added CSS to the HTML that we had already developed in order to make it look like the landing page we had created. With CSS, we were able to apply styles to the HTML elements such as changing the font, color, and size of text, as well as adding borders and backgrounds to the different sections of the page. This allowed us to make the HTML structure look more visually appealing and consistent with the landing page design. Overall, the addition of CSS was a crucial step in finalizing the web development process and achieving the desired look and feel for our webpage.
## Week-04:
In the fourth week of our web development course, we styled our HTML using flexbox, following the mobile-first paradigm. We then used media queries to adapt the design for tablet and desktop versions, creating responsive and visually appealing web pages.
